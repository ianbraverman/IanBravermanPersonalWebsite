              As a recent graduate from FullStack Academy, I am eager and ready
              to embark on a dynamic journey as a Full-Stack web developer.
              Prior to my immersive coding experience, I served as a Financial
              Advisor at Merrill Lynch, developing expertise in finance. I
              graduated from the University of Connecticut with a major in
              Finance and a minor in Economics. With a strong foundation in
              business and banking principles, I am looking to transition into
              the tech realm.

            My academic tenure at the University of Connecticut was enriched by
            active participation in diverse extracurricular activities.
            Memberships included Finance Society, the Rolling Tones A-Cappella
            Group, Collegium Choir, Super Smash Brothers Melee Club, and the
            Magic The Gathering Club. Following graduation, I embarked on a
            fulfilling journey as a Financial Advisor at Merrill Lynch from 2020
            to 2023. However, driven by an enduring passion for technology and a
            thirst for continuous learning, I've chosen to pivot my career path
            toward Software Engineering. Excited to immerse myself in this
            dynamic field, I am poised to embrace the challenges and
            opportunities that lie ahead.
