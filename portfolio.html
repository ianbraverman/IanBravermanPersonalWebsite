                In 2023, I took the Udemy course "The Complete Python Bootcamp
                From Zero To Hero in Python". This course was an excellent
                introduction for me into software engineering and programming,
                and was a big factor for me deciding to join the FullStack
                Academy Software Engineering bootcamp.
              </p>
              <p>
                The capstone project for the course was creating the cardgame
                Blackjack in Python. The game works by importing the random
                library, and defining the classes for each individual card, for
                creating the deck, the player and computers hand, and the game
                chips.

                After completing the "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero To
                Hero in Python", I have created multiple small projects in
                python to continue my learning. By following a code along video
                linked in the github repository, I created the game hangman.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a great learning experience because it involved pulling
                content from a website to randomly generate the words from a
                list of 10000, creating very rudementary images that the user
                sees, and the game logic was very concise.
              </p>

              <p>
                After finishing the hangman tutorial, I created multiple popular
                games with the knowledge I learned. This image is of the game
                password, where the player is given the first letter of a word,
                and a clue for that word. If the player is able to guess the
                word, they get full points, if they are unable to guess the
                word, they get one less point, and are given another clue.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a fun and rewarding experience because I was able to
                create this without any tutorials, and required multiple skill
                sets to create.
