                Ever since I was a child I have had a passion for music.
                Throughout middle school and high school I performed in various
                choirs, musicals, and competitions. Some of my favorite roles I
                had in musicals include Motel Kamzoil in Fiddler on the roof,
                The Wolf in Into The Woods, and Enoch Snow in Carousel.
              </p>
              <p>
                In college, I was in multiple groups including the Rolling Tones
                A-Cappela Group, Collegium Choir, UCONN Concert Choir, and
                Marriage of Figaro Opera. My favorite memory of performing in
                college was traveling with Collegium Choir and Uconn Concert
                Choir to Italy, and performing in various exciting locations
                including the Sistine Chapel.

              Currently, I do not do as much performing as I used to. With the
              global pandemic, I did not have much opportunity to perform.
              However, I am currently a member of the Professional Connecticut
              choir, Voce.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going forward, I have great aspirations to sing and perform more.
              Upon graduation from FullStack Academy, I hope to move to a fun
              city and join a choir there.

                I love to travel! As a child, I was fortunate to have my parents
                take me on many beautiful vacations. Some examples include
                Israel for my Bar Mitzvah, Florida, and Arizona.
              </p>

                In College, I went on multiple awesome trips. As previously
                mentioned, I traveled with the UCONN choirs to Italy, and also
                studied abroad for the summer of softmore year in Ecuador. In
                Ecaudor, I lived with host families in three cities; Saraguro,
                Cuenca, and Riobamba. It was a lot of fun, and helped me to
                improve my Spanish.

              Over the last few years, I have been on multiple exciting trips.
              Prior to starting FullStack Academy, I traveled with my friend to
              Europe. We visited multiple cities spanning multiple countries
              including London, Barcelona, Madrid, and Paris. Some highlights of
              the trip included going to a Real Madrid soccor game, watching a
              Flamenco show, and seeing the Opera Rigoletto.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going forward, I plan to do a lot more traveling. After graduating
              from FullStack Acadmemy, I want to do another big trip to Europe
              or South America. The next places I want to visit are Amsterdam,
              Dublin, and Lisbon.

                Magic The Gathering is my favorite game, and I have been playing
                competitively and casually for many years. I was first
                introduced to it in third grade by my friend, and have been
                hooked ever since. I have been playing the game consistently for
                most of my life. Many of my best friends have been made through
                this game.
              </p>
              <p>
                In high school and college, I competed in multiple tournaments,
                with my best tournament finish having been obtaining second
                place at an Invitational Qualifier the Summer of 2019. I also
                played the game casually with friends, in local game stores, and
                at conventions across the United States.

              Since graduating from college, I have continued to play both
              tournament and casual magic, mostly focusing on the formats Cube
              and Draft. My best tournament finishes in recent years include
              placing in the top 64 of both CubeCon 2022 and 2023 in Madison,
              Wisconsin.

            <p>
              Going forward, I plan to continue competing in Magic The Gathering
              tournaments, and playing casually with my friends. I run a Magic
              The Gathering cube discord for coordinating weekly meetups within
              the local area. This year I hope to obtain top 8 of CubeCon 2024!
