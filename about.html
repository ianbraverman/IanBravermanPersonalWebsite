                Music has been an integral part of my life since childhood. From
                my formative years in middle school to the crescendo of high
                school, I immersed myself in various choirs, musicals, and
                competitions. Among my cherished roles were Motel Kamzoil in
                "Fiddler on the Roof," The Wolf in "Into The Woods," and Enoch
                Snow in "Carousel."
              </p>
              <p>
                My passion for music continued to flourish in college, where I
                actively participated in esteemed groups such as the Rolling
                Tones A-Cappella Group, Collegium Choir, UCONN Concert Choir,
                and Marriage of Figaro Opera. One of my most memorable
                experiences was touring Italy with the Collegium Choir and UCONN
                Concert Choir, performing in iconic venues including the
                illustrious Sistine Chapel.

              Currently, my opportunities for performing have been limited due
              to the global pandemic. However, I am currently a member of the
              Professional Connecticut choir, Voce.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I have great aspirations to sing and perform more.
              Now that I have graduated from FullStack Academy, I am eager to
              embark on new adventures. My goal is to move to a vibrant city and
              join a choir there, immersing myself in both the local culture and
              the world of music.

                Traveling holds a special place in my heart. From my childhood,
                I was fortunate to embark on memorable vacations with my
                parents. Highlights include celebrating my Bar Mitzvah in
                Israel, exploring the sunny shores of Florida, and marveling at
                the desert landscapes of Arizona.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my college years, I continued to indulge my wanderlust
                with exhilarating trips. As mentioned earlier, I joined the
                UCONN choirs on a captivating journey to Italy, where we
                performed in renowned venues such as the Sistine Chapel.
                Additionally, I seized the opportunity to broaden my horizons by
                studying abroad in Ecuador during the summer of my sophomore
                year. Living with host families in cities like Saraguro, Cuenca,
                and Riobamba was not only a lot of fun but also a transformative
                experience that significantly enhanced my Spanish proficiency.

              Over the past few years, I've embarked on several exhilarating
              adventures. Prior to commencing my journey at FullStack Academy, I
              explored Europe with a close friend. Our itinerary spanned
              multiple cities and countries, including London, Barcelona,
              Madrid, and Paris. Memorable highlights of the trip included
              attending a Real Madrid soccer game, immersing ourselves in a
              captivating Flamenco show, and experiencing the timeless beauty of
              the opera "Rigoletto."

              Looking ahead, my wanderlust remains strong. Now that I've
              graduated from FullStack Academy, I'm eager to embark on another
              grand adventure, whether it leads me to Europe or South America.
              Amsterdam, Dublin, and Lisbon are at the top of my list for future
              exploration.

                Magic: The Gathering holds a special place in my heart as my
                favorite game, and I've been immersed in both competitive and
                casual play for many years. Introduced to the game by a friend
                in third grade, I've been captivated ever since, forging lasting
                friendships along the way.

              <p>
                Throughout high school and college, I delved deeper into the
                competitive scene, participating in numerous tournaments. Among
                my proudest achievements was securing second place at an
                Invitational Qualifier in the summer of 2019. Additionally, I
                cherished the casual gatherings with friends at local game
                stores and conventions across the United States, where the joy
                of the game transcended competition.

              Since graduating from college, my passion for Magic: The Gathering
              has remained unwavering, with a focus on both tournament and
              casual play, particularly in the Cube and Draft formats. Among my
              recent highlights, I achieved notable tournament finishes by
              placing in the top 64 of both CubeCon 2022 and 2023 in Madison,
              Wisconsin.

              Looking ahead, I'm committed to furthering my journey in Magic:
              The Gathering, both competitively and socially. I continue to
              compete in tournaments and enjoy casual play with friends.
              Additionally, I spearhead a Magic: The Gathering cube discord,
              facilitating weekly meetups within the local community. This year,
              my sights are set on achieving a top 8 finish at CubeCon 2024!
