              Eager to embark on a dynamic journey as a Full-Stack web
              developer, I recently graduated from FullStack Academy, brimming
              with enthusiasm and readiness. Prior to my immersive coding
              experience, I served as a Financial Advisor at Merrill Lynch,
              leveraging my expertise in finance. My academic journey at the
              University of Connecticut equipped me with a major in Finance and
              a minor in Economics, laying a strong foundation for my transition
              into the tech realm.

            My academic tenure at the University of Connecticut, culminating in
            2020, was marked by active participation in diverse extracurricular
            activities. Engaging in the Rolling Tones A-Cappella Group, Finance
            Society, Super Smash Brothers Melee Club, Magic The Gathering Club,
            and Collegium Choir enriched my collegiate experience. Following
            graduation, I embarked on a fulfilling journey as a Financial
            Advisor at Merrill Lynch from 2020 to 2023. However, driven by an
            enduring passion for technology and a thirst for continuous
            learning, I've chosen to pivot my career path toward Software
            Engineering. Excited to immerse myself in this dynamic field, I am
            poised to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
